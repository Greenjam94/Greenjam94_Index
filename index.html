        <h4>Hello There,</h4>
        <p>I'm James Green, or Greenjam94. I'm a Media and information student at Michigan State University with a minor
         in Computer Science. I've been coding since my freshman year at MSU, and I've lost track of all the things that I have done.
         I'm using a combination of my skills to write these websites to showcase what exactly it is that I have accomplished. Please visit my <a href="http://blog.greenjam94.me">Dev Blog</a> to learn more about my projects.</p>

        <p>This is a good time to mention that my Dev Blog also doubles as my Hacking Blog, In the spring of 2015 there was a class
          that required me to write a semester long project, so I'll be sharing what I learned with you on that same blog, just
          select the hacking category!</p>

        <h4>Hacking</h4>
        <p>My freshman year at MSU, I found a group called "Defense against the dark arts". It was a group of upperclassmen that got
          together and reviewed some basic hacking techniques like DDOS, MITM, and more. That group introduced me to BackTrack and Kali.
          This started me down the path towards information security. Unfortunately, most group members graduated the semester I joined,
          and the club soon disbanded afterwards.</p>
        <p>In my junior year, I joined another group called "Spartan Hackers". They put on Spartahack, a collegiate level hackathon that
        is a 36 hour coding competition. It had hacking in the name so I jumped onboard. While it's not infosec, it is a good way to show
        off my development skills. I volunteered that year to help out, currently I'm on the club's eboard as the "Web Developer" which puts me in charge of <a href="http://spartanhackers.com/">spartanhackers.com</a>. This design isn't mine, but I will be remaking the site
        in PHP this year so we can add some cool features.</p>
        <p>Just this summer I got more vocal on twitter and found an awesome group in Michigan called <a href="http://michsec.org/">#MiSec</a>.
         They're a bunch of security people who talked at cons and have a lot of fun. After meeting some of them, I was picking locks and 
         attempting to help with projects by the end of the night. I hope things will get better from here. #MiSec found me because I'll be 
         volunteering at <a href="http://grrcon.com/">GrrCon15</a>.</p>

        <h4 style="clear:both;">Developing</h4>
        <p>Since I was in middle school, I knew that I wanted to get a job with computers. By the time I was in high school, I
          narrowed it down to something with programming a computer. It was all the hacking movies and big salary jobs that were 
          being offered. However the only class offered at my high school was a basic web design class that showed us how to
          make sites with Dreamweaver.</p>
        <p>After coming to college, my abilities soared. Thanks to classes, work, and personal projects I can now do so much
          more. I know specific languages like Python, C++, Java, and PHP. I've made programs that run in IDEs, web
          applications, bash, and others. I'm always trying to learn more. Currently web development is taking up most of my
          time since it's what I do at work and for school clubs. I'm trying to expand my python skills since it seems to be a
          popular language in the infosec world.</p>

        <h4>Martial Arts<a name="contact"></a><img src="images/Sword.jpg" id="Sword"></h4>
        <p>I've been studying martial arts since I was in the third grade. I've earned my second degree black belt in Tang 
          Soo Do while studying at the <a href="http://www.worldclassinstituteofmartialarts.com/">World Class Institute of Martial Arts</a>. The road to my black belt was harder than I expected. I even quit for three years before returning to prove to myself that I could reach this goal. Now I look back and am proud to see how much I've changed, both physically and mentally.</p>
        <p>In highscool, I wrestled for three years. I had a hard time transitioning from the grappling of Tang Soo Do to the rules of 
          wrestling. My first year I think I went without a single win. However I kept at it, conditioning made me a lot stronger and by my
          senior year, I made varsity. I won enough matches that year to get my varsity letter and I couldn't be happier about it.</p>
        <p>I have also experimented with Tae Kwon Do, Judo, and mixed martial arts (MMA) while studying at MSU. While I haven't been able to train outside of clubs and classes, I have learned a lot in my last three years. MSUMMA was the first place I picked up sparring/boxing. Judo was where I adapted some basic take-down knowledge into precise techniques.</p>

        <h4>Scouting / Outdoors</h4>
        <p>Before I came to college, I was really into scouting. I earned the rank of eagle scout my last year of high
         school. My favorite part of scouts was the high adventure trips, I've climbed over 10 different mountains across
         the United States. I was also the Senior Patrol Leader ("President") for a year and have many years of leadership
         experience from past positions. The picture below is from my second trip to Philmont where I was the leader of the trek.</p>
